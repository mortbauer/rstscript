USAGE                                                   *rstscript-usage*

The basic steps for using this plugin are:
	- setup the buffer by calling |rstscript#SetupLitrunner|
	- run litrunner on the buffer by calling |rstscript#Run|

For convenience there is also a function (|rstscript#Watch|) which will setup
an autocommand for calling |rstscript#Run| every time you save the buffer

*rstscript#SetupLitrunner*

	you need to call it with an argument specifieng the filename of the
	weaving output. It will setup a project for the current buffer.

*rstscript#Run*

	no argument needed for this function. It will run the project if already
	setuped.

*rstscript#Watch*

	this function needs the same argument as |rstscript#SetupLitrunner| since
	it calls that function and sets up an autocommand to invoke
	|rstscript#Run| on every buffer write.

*rstscript#RunUpdate*

	this function calls |rstscript#Run| and the update the buffer of the
	outputfile if it is opened in vim. This function is called by
	|rstscript#Watch| automatically on every buffer saveing.


In order to reload the changed output buffer automatically without asking you
need to set |autoread| for that buffer. If you don't like that you know have
to press enter after each saving you could map some keys for convenience, for
example:

	:nnoremap <leader>w :w<CR><CR>
	:inoremap <leader>w :w<CR><CR>
